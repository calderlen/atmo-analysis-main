todo
- Check the aliases against detections for all species that aren't Fe I, making sure that the Kp slice is the same for each, which may explain the obvious aliasing but significant velocity offset you're seseing in each alias, e.g. Mg I. Also, this may have to do with the redshifted absolute velocity offsets you're seeing.

to talk to marshall about at the meeting tomorrow
- The phase-dependent or limb asymmetries I'm seeing align with previous studies and theoretical work. The scale height effect should be causing these asymmetries, we are observing a puffed atmosphere on the trailing limb.
- Review the eccentricity calculations with him, as these can cause up to 1kms blueshift

- updates
	- new figure combining Kp-Vsys maps, 1D CCFs, and wind profiles
		- do you like the 6x3 with the wind evolution or do you think it's better to have the maps and 1d ccfs only and the wind profiles separate? i combined them because i was just planning on combining each of the wind profiles and gaussian centers, as is done in Figure 2, 3, and 4. I was also considering just moving Figure 1 into the appendix alongside the model spectra
		- still need to add captions, make a couple small changes, add table compiling all of the fit as you said
	- I addressed just about all of the other comments you and Ji added

- feedback
	- In Figure 2, try a different method of color scaling for these to better highlight the SNR changes over the course of transit. for example: difference wrt peak SNR 
	- redo chromium hydride as it was claimed in detection transmission for another ultra hot jupiter, it was recently added to Sydney's onedirve
	- potentially inject model species into the spectra to provide more quantitative assessment 
		run_all_ccfs(do_inject=True) will inject a model spectrum and try to recover it. The reason it's not completely accurate because you're trying to recover with the same template you cross-correlate with
- Add log output in run_all_ccfs and/or multiSpeciesCCF + combinedPhaseResolvedLineProfiles


- Write your introduction like:

	- Many atomic species such as FeI, FeII, CaII, NaI, and
	HI have been detected in its atmosphere through transit spec-
	troscopy, while there are only tentative detections of MgI and
	CrII (Casasayas-Barris et al. 2018, 2019; Hoeijmakers et al.
	2020; Nugroho et al. 2020; Stangret et al. 2020). There are
	also indications of a day- to night-side wind by a blueshift of
	−6.3 ± 0.8 km s−1 in the FeI signal and −2.8 ± 0.8 km s−1 in
	that due to FeII (Stangret et al. 2020; Hoeijmakers et al. 2020;
	Nugroho et al. 2020).

	- KELT-20b (Lund et al. 2017), also known as MASCARA-2b
	(Talens et al. 2018), is a well-known ultra-hot Jupiter orbiting a
	fast-rotating A-type star. With a period of 3.47 days and a semi-
	major axis of 0.0542 au, KELT-20b is highly irradiated by its
	host star (A2, T eff = 8980 K, mV = 7.6), and its atmosphere
	reaches Teq = 2260 K (see Table 1 for more details of the system).
	
	
		
3.
	3.1 Data Preparation
	3.2 Model Spectra
		- FEEDBACK
			- find citation for why transmission spectra are less sensitive to detailed vertical temperature structures
			- CHECK YOUR TENSE, PAST/PRESENT
			- list all species you considered OR if the number is large, name a few key species and quote the number
	3.3 Cross-correlation
		- FEEDBACK
			- I also need to describe how this model is computed, briefly. You should discuss this with Marshall.
				- EXPLAIN WHY THIS STEP IS NECSSARY.
			- State the methodology for creating the Kp-Vsys map more clearly. Use subfield-proper language to do so. "Map", "grid search", "free parameter".
				- mention what range of Kp values and Vsys values you consider in the search, and if these differ from the values you actually consider physical
			- "We select the exposure with peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)" WRONG. find the location in the Kp-vsys map with the highest SNR, and use that value of Kp for the rest of this analysis?
			-
		- TODO
			- set the Kp-Vsys maps to have a red X at peak SNR. Potentially inlcude a horizontal line as well to show where you're extracting the 1-D SNR Gaussian fits from
			
	3.4 Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect
		- finalize description of rossiter-mclaughlin effect by compiling information from other papers

	3.5 Wind Velocities
		- FEEDBACK
			- you need to fix the SNR-gaussian plot fits potentially, as they are showing the velocity at peak SNR, but these velocities are not necessarily representative OR that valuable to the analysis of the wind velocities. their behavior of the course of transit is more valuable.
				- remove the listing of parameters on each plot as relevant parameters are better displayed on tables anyway.
			- make it clear that you are doing a separate Gaussian fit to each of the in-transit CCFs and it is the peak velocity and width for these fits which is shown.
			- "We repeat this process for each species meeting the ${3\sigma}$ detection threshold, then overlay the results." Doesn't need to be said in the main text. Put this in the captions. FIgure captions should describe what is shown in the figure, while the main text should be focused more on the reasoning for the analysis and the conclusions enabled by what is shown in the figure.
		- TODO				
			- wind characteristics
				- make the plot 6x1 instead of 3x2, using subplot in python rather than putting them 3x2 in LaTeX subplots
					- this will eliminate redundant orbital phase x-axis. instead, an x-axis at the top of the plot and one at the bottom of the plot that have orbital phase. then add vertical lines at each 0.01 increment of orbital phase that extend across all plots. 
					- also you need to change the scaling of the plots. and remove the 'Center' legend. In the caption for the main figure. Describe the y-axis and x-axis in detail. Describe the shading that represents the uncertainty.
					- If you're considering including neutral Nickel, you will put this plot in a separate figure, where you make it clear that this is from only one arm and is extremely tentative.
			
4. Results
	4.1 Analysis of Detections
	4.2 Atmospheric Dynamics
		- (Cite M. Stangret et al. when discussing this) There is a consistent offset between the wind velocities obtained for Fe I and Fe II, suggesting we are probing these elements at different pressures, where Fe II is in the upper atmosphere and Fe I is deeper, where the increased pressure causes spectral broadening of its lines. Note that the wind velocities we find are roughly equal 
		- your combined-wind-characteristics plot is incorrect. the legend colors do not match the colors on the plot.
			
			
		- add periodic table where you note which species were tested, color coding to show those that met the tentative detection threshold and detection threshold
			- discuss these results briefly as compared with Kesseli et al 2022 and Hoeijmakers et al 2019
		- plot of example telluric corrections by molecfit?
		- plots of P vs VMR (abundance profiles), figure out how to do this in FastChem
		-   We find the pressure levels of each species using the pressure contribution function within \code{PyFastChem}, choosing the peak pressure and displaying the error bars as the 1-sigma range of pressure contribution in Table XXXXXX.

- other
	- is it correct to assume the VMR of Fe II equal to that of Fe I? Probably not. See what you can do about this!

	- CONSISTENT TENSE!!!!
